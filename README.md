## What I enjoy

- **JavaScript**: All things JS, front to back and everything in between
- **React**: Composable views with a dedicated focus on reusability
- **Redux**: Conscious state flow and management honoring immutability
- **Async flows**: Promises to the rescue *(need to learn async/await)*
- **Tests**: The more the better but not at the expense of progress
