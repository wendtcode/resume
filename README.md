#### JavaScript craftsman with a knack for developing ideas into Web applications that are rich, responsive, and resilient by applying some artistry, innovation, and experience (often supplemented by coffee).

### Who I am

- **Father**: Energetic 8-year-old son and adorable twin 6-year-old daughters
- **Husband**: Just celebrated 10 years of marriage with my highschool sweetheart
- **Outdoorsman**: Nothing better for the soul than nature
- **Coder**: Self-taught, passionate craftsman ready to work, teach, and learn

### What I enjoy

- **JavaScript**: All things JS, front to back and everything in between *(especially ES6+)*
- **React**: Composable views with a dedicated focus on reusability
- **Redux**: Conscious state flow and management honoring immutability
- **Node**: Microservices with consistent APIs and dedicated backends
- **Tests**: The more the better but not at the expense of progress
- **Functional paradigms**: Expressive units of code without side-effects

### What I have worked on

- **React apps**: Tackled all variety of sizes, complexities, and architectural states
- **React component libraries**: Purposeful blocks of reusable functionality
- **Node microservices**: Workhorses with dedicated purpose
- **Unit tests**: Red light... green light... repeat...
- **Webpack bundling**: Transpilation,  minification, hot reloading

### How I work

- **Early**: Early to bed, early to wake... seems like my code is less likely to break
- **Diligently**: Focused on the task at hand until it's finished
- **Agile**: In both formal process and in flexible practice
- **Autonomous**: I favor problem solving over prescribed solutions
- **Collaborative**: Teams build great things, not individuals
- **Remote**: Fully capable of managing time, work, and availability
